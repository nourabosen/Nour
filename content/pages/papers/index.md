Here, I document my journey exploring how machine learning can create meaningful impact, from decoding brain signals to improving health outcomes.
### [A Deep Learning Approach to EEG-to-Text Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17465)
Presenting a deep learning framework for open-vocabulary EEG-to-text decoding, integrating subject-specific EEG features with NLP. Outperforming baselines on ZuCo (BLEU/ROUGE/BERTScore), it enables personalized brain-to-text generation for assistive communication.

### [Diabetes Tracker](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10479629)
Diabetes tracker project focuses on the development and implementation of machine learning models for predicting diabetic blood glucose levels. By creating a reliable prediction model, individuals are strived to empower  with diabetes to take proactive control of their health.
