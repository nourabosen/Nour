Here, I showcase my diverse range of creations and endeavors, reflecting my passion for mathematics, technology and innovation.
### [InsightMiner](https://github.com/nourabosen/InsightMiner)
InsightMiner is a local Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that allows you to search, extract quotes, and summarize insights from your document collection—all without sending data to external servers.

### [Logseq Blogpost Uploader](https://github.com/nourabosen/LogseqBlogpostUploader)
A Python script designed to automate the uploading of Logseq-written blog posts to a GitHub repository, while also saving a copy in a designated local folder.

### [Kindle Highlights Organizer](https://github.com/nourabosen/KindleHighlightsOrganizer)
This Python script is designed to parse and organize highlights and notes from a Kindle "My Clippings.txt" file. It extracts the highlights and associated notes, removes duplicates and partial duplicates, and writes the organized content into a new file. The structured output is compatible with outliner note-taking apps like Logseq, Obsidian, Roam Research, and others, making it easy to integrate into your knowledge management workflow.

### [Pi's Visualization](https://nourabosen.netlify.app/posts/crafting-pi's-visual-symphony)
As a celebration of Pi Day, I visualized the first 10k digits of Pi as circles, where the size and the colour of the circle depend on the digit value. If it is the same as the previous one, the circle size increases by 5x; otherwise, a new circle is added.

### [Pi as Music](https://nourabosen.netlify.app/posts/pi-as-music-pi-day-2025)
Transforming the digits of pi (π) into a musical composition using Sonic Pi, a code-based music creation tool.

### [Trashful](https://trashful.wixsite.com/application)
A platform to promote recycling locally by allowing users to trade waste for items using a point system.

### [Maze Solver](https://github.com/nourabosen/MazeSolver)
A Python program to generate and solve mazes using BFS algorithm.

=======
### [FPLForecaster](https://github.com/nourabosen/FPLForecaster)
Engineered a predictive analytics system for Fantasy Premier League (FPL) player points utilizing **LSTM/GRU deep learning models** in **Python**; deployed the interactive forecasting tool via **Streamlit**.

### [FileFlow](https://github.com/nourabosen/FileFlow)
Created the **FileFlow Ulauncher extension** to deliver instant, high-speed file search functionality across Linux environments, achieving performance gains by leveraging native **plocate/locate** indexes.

### [Rubik's Cube Solver](https://github.com/nourabosen/rubiks-cube-solver)
Implemented a **Python-based Rubik's Cube Solver** featuring live webcam color detection for input, coupled with a full **3D graphical interface** to visualize the solving process.

### [InsightMiner](https://github.com/nourabosen/InsightMiner)
Designed and deployed **InsightMiner**, a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system built to efficiently search, query, and generate contextual summaries from extensive Markdown document collections.

### [Kindle Highlights Organizer](https://github.com/nourabosen/KindleHighlightsOrganizer)
Automated the organization and cleaning of raw Kindle reading data by developing a robust **Python script** to parse, structure, and export highlights into clean, consumable formats.

### [ChatBotA](https://github.com/nourabosen/ChatBotA)
Engineered **ChatBotA**, an interactive, **AI-powered mobile assistant** using **React Native** for the frontend and integrating specific natural language models from the **Hugging Face** library.

### [Blogpost Uploader](https://github.com/nourabosen/LogseqBlogpostUploader/)
Streamlined the content workflow by creating a **Python automation script** that parses **Logseq** formats and automatically commits/uploads finalized blog posts to a **GitHub repository**.

### [Maze Solver](https://github.com/nourabosen/MazeSolver)
Developed a comprehensive **Maze Solver** program in **Python** capable of generating random maze structures and efficiently calculating the shortest solution path using the **Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm**.

### [Trashful](https://trashful.wixsite.com/application)
Co-developed **Trashful**, a local recycling incentive platform that successfully promoted community engagement by implementing a **gamified point-exchange system** for traded waste materials.

### Published Research Papers
**[Bridging Brain Signals and Language: A Deep Learning Approach to EEG-to-Text Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17465)**
Proposed a novel **EEG-to-text decoding framework** that integrates subject-specific learning models with advanced NLP techniques to enable open-vocabulary signal interpretation.

**[Improving Diabetes Forecasting: An Ensemble Approach with Feature Selection in Time Series Analysis](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10479629)**
Contributed to global health data analysis by applying an **ensemble forecasting approach** with specific feature selection techniques to improve the accuracy of diabetes time series prediction.
