Here, I showcase my diverse range of creations and endeavors, reflecting my passion for mathematics, technology and innovation.

### [A Deep Learning Approach to EEG-to-Text Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17465)
Presenting a deep learning framework for open-vocabulary EEG-to-text decoding, integrating subject-specific EEG features with NLP. Outperforming baselines on ZuCo (BLEU/ROUGE/BERTScore), it enables personalized brain-to-text generation for assistive communication.

### [Diabetes Tracker](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10479629)
Diabetes tracker project focuses on the development and implementation of machine learning models for predicting diabetic blood glucose levels. By creating a reliable prediction model, individuals are strived to empower  with diabetes to take proactive control of their health.

### [Logseq Blogpost Uploader](https://github.com/nourabosen/LogseqBlogpostUploader)
A Python script designed to automate the uploading of Logseq-written blog posts to a GitHub repository, while also saving a copy in a designated local folder.

### [Kindle Highlights Organizer](https://github.com/nourabosen/KindleHighlightsOrganizer)
This Python script is designed to parse and organize highlights and notes from a Kindle "My Clippings.txt" file. It extracts the highlights and associated notes, removes duplicates and partial duplicates, and writes the organized content into a new file. The structured output is compatible with outliner note-taking apps like Logseq, Obsidian, Roam Research, and others, making it easy to integrate into your knowledge management workflow.

### [Pi's Visualization](https://nourabosen.netlify.app/posts/crafting-pi's-visual-symphony)
As a celebration of Pi Day, I visualized the first 10k digits of Pi as circles, where the size and the colour of the circle depend on the digit value. If it is the same as the previous one, the circle size increases by 5x; otherwise, a new circle is added.

### [Pi as Music](https://nourabosen.netlify.app/posts/pi-as-music-pi-day-2025)
Transforming the digits of pi (Ï€) into a musical composition using Sonic Pi, a code-based music creation tool.

### [Trashful](https://trashful.wixsite.com/application)
A platform to promote recycling locally by allowing users to trade waste for items using a point system.

### [Maze Solver](https://github.com/nourabosen/MazeSolver)
A Python program to generate and solve mazes using BFS algorithm.
