### [FPLForecaster](https://github.com/nourabosen/FPLForecaster)
Engineered a predictive analytics system for Fantasy Premier League (FPL) player points utilizing **LSTM/GRU deep learning models** in **Python**; deployed the interactive forecasting tool via **Streamlit**.

### [FileFlow](https://github.com/nourabosen/FileFlow)
Created the **FileFlow Ulauncher extension** to deliver instant, high-speed file search functionality across Linux environments, achieving performance gains by leveraging native **plocate/locate** indexes.

### [Rubik's Cube Solver](https://github.com/nourabosen/rubiks-cube-solver)
Implemented a **Python-based Rubik's Cube Solver** featuring live webcam color detection for input, coupled with a full **3D graphical interface** to visualize the solving process.

### [InsightMiner](https://github.com/nourabosen/InsightMiner)
Designed and deployed **InsightMiner**, a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system built to efficiently search, query, and generate contextual summaries from extensive Markdown document collections.

### [Kindle Highlights Organizer](https://github.com/nourabosen/KindleHighlightsOrganizer)
Automated the organization and cleaning of raw Kindle reading data by developing a robust **Python script** to parse, structure, and export highlights into clean, consumable formats.

### [ChatBotA](https://github.com/nourabosen/ChatBotA)
Engineered **ChatBotA**, an interactive, **AI-powered mobile assistant** using **React Native** for the frontend and integrating specific natural language models from the **Hugging Face** library.

### [Blogpost Uploader](https://github.com/nourabosen/LogseqBlogpostUploader/)
Streamlined the content workflow by creating a **Python automation script** that parses **Logseq** formats and automatically commits/uploads finalized blog posts to a **GitHub repository**.

### [Maze Solver](https://github.com/nourabosen/MazeSolver)
Developed a comprehensive **Maze Solver** program in **Python** capable of generating random maze structures and efficiently calculating the shortest solution path using the **Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm**.

### [Trashful](https://trashful.wixsite.com/application)
Co-developed **Trashful**, a local recycling incentive platform that successfully promoted community engagement by implementing a **gamified point-exchange system** for traded waste materials.
