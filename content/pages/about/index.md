Hello there!

I'm Nour Alhuda, and I've just graduated with a degree in computer science engineering at E-JUST. But I prefer not to be called an engineer. I completed my high school education at Kafr Elsheikh STEM High School in the class of '20.

One of my greatest passions is mathematics, which has been a driving force in various aspects of my life. It has provided me with valuable insights and has motivated me to excel. However, you'll learn more about me through my upcoming blog posts.

When it comes to social media, my favourite platform is Twitter. It's the place where you'll usually find me, unless Elon Musk has somehow managed to ruin it. Feel free to check out my Twitter account [here üê¶](https://twitter.com/NourAbosen). And oops, he ruined it.
If you have any questions or would like to know anything else, please don't hesitate to ask.
