My passion for mathematics has been the driving force behind both my personal and academic journey. It shapes the way I think, guides the choices I make, and continuously fuels my pursuit of knowledge and innovation. To me, mathematics is not merely a subject but a framework for reasoning, discovery, and problem-solving that extends to every aspect of my life. And by the way, I'm a computer engineer.
