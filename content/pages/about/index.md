# Hello there!

I'm Nour Alhuda, a senior student pursuing a degree in Computer Science Engineering at E-JUST. While I am studying engineering, I prefer not to be referred to as an engineer. I completed my high school education at Kafr Elsheikh STEM High School in the class of '20.

## Passion for Mathematics

One of my greatest passions is mathematics, which has played a pivotal role in various aspects of my life. It has provided me with valuable insights and served as a constant motivation to strive for excellence. In my upcoming blog posts, you will get to know more about how mathematics has influenced me and my work.
