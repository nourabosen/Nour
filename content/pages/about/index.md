Hello there!

I'm Nour Alhuda, currently a senior student pursuing a degree in computer science engineering at E-JUST. Although I'm studying engineering, I prefer not to be called an engineer. I completed my high school education at Kafr Elsheikh STEM High School in the class of '20.

One of my greatest passions is mathematics, which has been a driving force in various aspects of my life. It has provided me with valuable insights and has motivated me to excel. However, you'll get to know more about me through my upcoming blog posts.

When it comes to social media, my favorite platform is Twitter. It's the place where you'll usually find me, unless Elon Musk has somehow managed to ruin it. Feel free to check out [my Twitter account here üê¶](https://twitter.com/NourAbosen).

If you have any questions or if there's anything else you'd like to know, feel free to ask!
