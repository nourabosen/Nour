"Take Me Home, United Road. Take me home, United Road, To the place I belong; To Old Trafford, to see United; Take me home, United Road."
Yeah, *that* chant. Those words. They're everything, aren't they? They're what you cling to, what inspires the team even when this season has been... well, you know. And they were absolutely pumping through my head during that comeback against Lyon. Seriously, what a match. Unforgettable doesn't even cover it.
Honestly, where do you even start? The first half was amazing, right? But then that second half... ugh, so frustrating. And then extra time. That damn, *DAMN* extra time. What a complete and utter rollercoaster. I'll be real, when we went 2-4 down, my heart just sank. I totally lost hope for a second. But deep inside, way, way down, there was still just this tiny little spark, maybe 1% faith, that we *could* still do it. And somehow, impossibly, we DID. In the most unbelievable way.
Casemiro! Man, he was the quiet hero, wasn't he? Winning that penalty. Even after Bruno scored it, that 1% was still shivering, you know? I was thinking, "Okay, maybe we just get another one for respect." But then, Kobbie Mainoo! That kid! What a finish! It just instantly reminded me of that Wolves goal. At that point, I was already bracing myself for penalties, already picturing us losing them because, let's be honest, I know that script.
But then, literally seconds later, HARRY MAGUIRE. I just... I had no words. I screamed, or maybe I didn't, I don't even know. I celebrated like a completely crazy kid, just hoping my dad didn't think I'd completely lost my mind. Those moments were unreal. Seriously, were they showing a different match on my screen? I didn't even recognise my own team in that fight. All I could do was pray – BEG – that they'd just keep it at 5-4, just don't concede again. And somehow, those absolute madmen did it. How they kept their heads, I have no idea. My nerves were shot, theirs must have been wires of steel.
This felt massive. More than just a win, it felt like a lifeline, a chance to save the season. Now, three huge Europa League games remain. Like Ruben Amorim apparently said, if you get to the semi-finals, you have to win it. The next opponent won't be easy, not by a long shot. But after that night? My belief in this club, in these players, is soaring. I believe they can find what's needed to win this Europa League. Remember last year? Amad Diallo's incredible winner against our rivals in the FA Cup quarter-final? That moment sparked something, didn't it? It fuelled the belief that won us the cup. I feel that same kind of energy radiating from Maguire's winner and the final whistle. Maybe this fight, this chaos, this belief is exactly what will carry them through in Europe. We just have to keep believing.
And my favourite player... Bruno Fernandes. The man just *takes* the club on his back, doesn't he? Takes all the responsibility. I just have to thank him. For that penalty that kicked everything off, the one I honestly first thought might just be pointless. He's been outstanding, carrying us so much this whole season. If anyone deserves to lift big trophies for Man United right now, it's him. I made him those pixel arts before because I just love his passion, and honestly, he deserves even more. So yeah, thank you, Bruno. My captain. For everything.
Thank you, Man United, for that insane, brilliant, nerve-wracking night. What a club.
