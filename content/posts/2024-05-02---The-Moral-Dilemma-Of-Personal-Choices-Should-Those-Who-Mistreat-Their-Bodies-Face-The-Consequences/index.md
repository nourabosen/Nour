 <br/>In our daily lives, we all make choices that can impact our well-being, some of which may lead to long-term detrimental effects on our bodies. The question arises: should individuals who mistreat their bodies suffer the consequences of their actions? This moral dilemma is at the heart of Glenda Cooper's 1997 article, "Should those who abuse their bodies pay the price?" In this exploration, we delve into the ethical and moral dimensions of this challenging issue.
 <br/>Cooper begins by highlighting the moral quandary surrounding whether individuals who make unhealthy choices should bear the burden of their actions. The underlying concern is whether it is justifiable to prioritize one person's treatment over another based on their lifestyle choices. The author raises the ethical question of denying treatment to those who contributed to their illness, creating a complex interplay between morality and medical care.
 <br/>The crux of Cooper's argument lies in the distinction between ethics and morality. While the two concepts are closely related, they differ in their emphasis. "Morals" refer to societal norms of right and wrong, while "ethics" delve into individual character and subjective notions of morality. Cooper's argument hinges on the understanding of these terms, as she explores whether some patients are more equal than others in the realm of medical care.
 <br/>Despite attempting to approach the issue ethically, Cooper's argument leans heavily towards the moral aspect. She advocates for equal treatment for all patients but later questions whether those responsible for their illnesses should be denied care. Inconsistencies arise as she presents cases of individuals, such as Harry, who are denied treatment due to their lifestyle choices. The author grapples with the ethical implications of withholding care from those who brought their illnesses upon themselves.
 <br/>Cooper supports her argument with analogies, but they serve to weaken rather than strengthen her position. Drawing parallels between adults who smoke and drink and children who consume sweets oversimplifies the complex nature of decision-making. Furthermore, the comparison between Nazis and doctors attempting to allocate organs is deemed inappropriate, as saving lives is fundamentally different from taking them.
 <br/>The article challenges readers to consider the consequences of unhealthy behaviors and whether denying treatment to those responsible for their illnesses is justifiable. Cooper argues that allocating organs to individuals who would benefit more is ethically sound, even if it goes against our natural instincts to prioritize our loved ones.
 <br/>In conclusion, the moral dilemma posed by Cooper raises thought-provoking questions about the intersection of ethics and medical care. The debate on whether individuals who mistreat their bodies should face the consequences of their actions is complex and multifaceted, requiring careful consideration of both ethical and moral perspectives. As we navigate this challenging terrain, it is essential to balance compassion with the responsible allocation of limited medical resources.
